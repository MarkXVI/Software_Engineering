slide 1: intro
singleton design patterns by mark harvey
slide 2: What is the Singleton Design Pattern?
Definition: Singleton Design Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
Usage: Ideal for situations where a single shared resource is needed, such as a database connection or a configuration manager.
Benefits: Ensures controlled access to the single instance, reduces the potential for bugs, and improves performance by eliminating redundant object creation.
slide 3: when to use
Logging
Configuration Management
Database Connections
Thread Pools

slide 8: Potential Drawbacks
Global State: Singleton can be considered an anti-pattern due to its global state, which can lead to issues when debugging.
Scalability: Difficult to scale in a multi-threaded environment.
Testing: Harder to unit test because of the hidden dependencies.
slide 9: Best Practices
Ensure thread-safety.
Consider alternatives like dependency injection.
Use the Singleton pattern judiciously and only when necessary.
slide 10: conclusion
Ensures a single instance of a class
Provides a global point of access
Useful for managing shared resources
Be cautious of potential drawbacks and use responsibly
