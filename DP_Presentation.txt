Slide 1: Intro
Welcome to today's presentation on Singleton Design Patterns. We will be discussing the Singleton pattern, its implementation, usage, and potential drawbacks. By me, Mark Harvey.

Slide 2: What is the Singleton Design Pattern?
The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful in situations where a single shared resource is needed, such as a database connection. Some benefits of using the Singleton pattern include controlled access to the single instance, reduction of potential bugs, and improved performance by eliminating redundant object creation.

Slide 3: When to Use
Singleton Design Pattern is ideally suited for situations such as:

Logging: Ensuring that log entries are organized and coherent by utilizing a single logging instance.
Configuration Management: Streamlining access and updates to application configurations. settings, etc.
Database Connections: Reducing overhead by sharing a single connection across the application.
Thread Pools: Managing a fixed number of worker threads for efficient resource utilization.

Slide 4: Code Example
Let's take a look at a couple of code examples:

Image 1: This is a typical implementation of a Singleton class, ensuring that only one instance is created.
Image 2: In this example, the Database Connection class is implemented as a Singleton, ensuring that only one connection object is shared across the application.

Slide 5: Diagrams
The class diagram showcases the Singleton class structure and its relationship with other classes in the system, providing a visual representation of the pattern's implementation.

In the diagram we have the Singleton class with:

A private attribute -instance of type Singleton: This attribute stores the single instance of the Singleton class.
A private constructor -Singleton(): This constructor is private to prevent creating new instances of the class from outside.
A public method +getInstance(): Singleton: This method returns the single instance of the Singleton class.

The sequence diagram illustrates the Singleton class creation process and how it interacts with other objects in the application, emphasizing the controlled access and communication.
Since the class is a Singleton, all attempts to create new instances will return the same object, ensuring that there's only one instance of the class throughout the program.

Slide 6: Potential Drawbacks
There are a few potential drawbacks to using the Singleton pattern:

Global State: Singleton can be considered an anti-pattern due to its global state, which can lead to issues when debugging.
Scalability: Singleton may be difficult to scale in a multi-threaded environment, potentially causing bottlenecks since there can only be one instance.
Testing: Singleton pattern can make unit testing harder due to the hidden dependencies or variables.

Slide 7: Best Practices
To make the most of the Singleton pattern, follow these best practices:

Ensure thread-safety: Implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions. fighting for the same thread
Use judiciously: Only use the Singleton pattern when necessary and beneficial.
Consider alternatives: Dependency injection can be a cleaner solution to manage dependencies.

Slide 8: Conclusion
In conclusion, the Singleton Design Pattern is a useful approach to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access. It can be beneficial for managing shared resources like logging or database connections. However, it is crucial to be aware of potential drawbacks and use the pattern responsibly. By following best practices, developers can effectively leverage the Singleton pattern to create robust and efficient applications.
